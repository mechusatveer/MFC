The difference between modal and modeless dialogs is not limited to MFC.

When a modal dialog is open you cannot interact with anything else than this modal 
dialog inside your program, as long as the modal dialog is open. Most dialogs are modal, 
for example the File-Save As dialogs are modal.On the other hand a modeless dialog behaves
just like a normal window, you can do anything you want while it is open. The spell checker
dialog in Microsoft Word is an example of such a dialog.
