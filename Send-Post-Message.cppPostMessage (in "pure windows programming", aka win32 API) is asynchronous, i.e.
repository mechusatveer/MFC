PostMessage (in "pure windows programming", aka win32 API) is asynchronous, i.e.
Places (posts) a message in the message queue associated with the thread that 
created the specified window and returns without waiting for the thread to
process the message.To post a message in the message queue associated with a
thread, use the PostThreadMessage function.

a window created by a thread so PostMessage we sending to a window so it check who is created it
that thread message queue it put

SendMessage is synchronous, that is, again quoting:

Sends the specified message to a window or windows. The SendMessage function 
calls the window procedure for the specified window and does not return until
the window procedure has processed the message.

To send a message and return immediately, use the SendMessageCallback or SendNotifyMessage function.
To post a message to a thread's message queue and return immediately, use the PostMessage or
PostThreadMessage function.
